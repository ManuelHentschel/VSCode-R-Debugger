# Contributing

This project is still under development and all contributions are welcome :)

If you encounter bugs/problems while using the debugger or have suggestions for new features, please open an issue on github.

If you want to contribute code but are unsure how/where to integrate your code in the package, please don't hesitate to ask and I'll try to clarify the packet structure or write some better documentation (which is naturally on the todo list anyways...).
